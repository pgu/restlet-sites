As a Restlet user, you'll have one team assigned to your account. 
You are a team owner. 
This team will be used across Restlet Client, Restlet Studio, and Restlet Cloud.

To access your team, open the Team menu from the profile drop-down menu in the header bar.

![Open the team screen](images/access_team.png "Open the team screen")

(Only you appear in the team)

![Initial team](images/team_empty.png "Initial team")

To add people to your team, search them by email. Then, they will be invited to join your team.

(A new member in your team)

Now, let's share a project with your team. In your repository, click on a project's menu to use the *Share* action. 

![Share a project](images/share_project.png "Share project")

Then, you set the project's visibility to Team.

![Set project visibility](images/project_visibility.png "Set project visibility")

Once a project is shared with your team members, it is displayed as green.
 
![Shared project](images/shared_project.png "Shared project")
 
From now on, your team members will see the shared project appear in their repositories, e.g.

![Shared project as team member](images/shared_project_as_team_member.png "Shared project as team member")
