As a Restlet user, you'll have one team assigned to your account. 
This team will be used across Restlet Client, Restlet Studio, and Restlet Cloud.

To access your team, open the **Team** menu from the profile drop-down menu in the header bar.
Currently, you are the only member of the team. You are the _team owner_. 

To add people to your team, search them by email. Then, if they are not already a user of Restlet products,
they will receive an invitation to join your team.
 
Now, let's share a project with your team. In your repository, click on a project's menu to use the *Share* action. 
Then, you set the project's visibility to `Team`. Once a project is shared with your team members, it is displayed as *green*.
 
From now on, your team members will see the shared project appear in their repositories under a new drive with your name.
