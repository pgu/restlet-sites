As a team member, you can see to which teams you belong to in the view **Repository**. 
For each team, you have a drive with the team owner's name.

The team owner may have already shared projects with you. Nonetheless, **you can also share projects with the team**.

In your repository, click on a project's menu to use the **Share** action.
Then, you set the project's **access to the team you want**.

> __Note:__ Here, the sharing is about **transferring** the project to the team. 
This implies *you will lose the project's management*, such as the delete action. 
It will be the team owner that will be able to manage the project.  

Once a project is shared, it is transferred to the team. The project doesn't appear anymore under MY DRIVE but **under the drive's team**.

From now on, the team owner will see the project in his drive and it will be displayed as a shared project (in **green**).

**TODO naming constraints**
